            My pet dog is Max. He is a golden retrevier. He love to run and play around the house.
            He doesn't hold back on what he likes to do. Some times Max would keep
            bugging me to take him to the park. I love his energetic attitude and every time he wants to go to the park
            he makes a cute face. He is currently 3 years old.

          <h2>Max's favorite food</h2>
          <p>
            Max loves to eat homemade food. Probably because that's what he's all ways been eating.
            Max seems to enjoy my beef stew the best! Everyday I will try to give Max something new to eat.
            That way Max will always look forwards
